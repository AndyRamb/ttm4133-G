    "- <u>1) Handover Request</u>: The S1 interface (S1AP protocol) is involved. Since there is no X2 interface among S-eNodeB and T-eNodeB (so that, direct forwarding is not an option), the source eNodeB decides to send the Handover Request to the MME. Depending on the TAI (Tracking Area ID) of the T-eNodeB, it's possible that the MME doesn't cover that base station: in this case the MME forwards the notification towards the corresponding MME covering the eNodeB. For the sake of simplicity, in our case the MME discovers that the T-eNodeB is covered. You can find target eNodeB Identity, the target TAI and the reason that triggered the handover procedure. Finally, you can find a transparent container in which there are some radio datas about the source cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <u>2) Handover Request</u>: The S1 interface (S1AP protocol) is involved. The MME forwards the Handover Request (generated by the S-eNodeB) towards the T-eNodeB. Hence, similar information are present. Furthermore, you can find the maximum aggregated bit-rate and a transparent container including the UE Capabilities, RRC Configuration, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <u>Handover Request Ack</u>: The S1 interface (S1AP protocol) is involved. The T-eNodeB allows the handover procedure to keep on going. You can find an EPS Bearer Setup List, that contains a list of addresses and TEIDs (one TEID per bearer) for downlink traffic between Serving-GW and T-eNodeB (S1-U reference point): one DL S1 TEID that the T-eNodeB allocated to the Serving-GW, and one DL S1 TEID that is referred to the indirect tunnel to reach the T-eNodeB. Furthermore, a transparent container is present, where the Handover Command message is carried. \n",
    "\n",
    "- <u>Create Indirect Forward Tunnel Request and Ack</u>: The S11 interface (GTPv2 protocol) is involved. The MME aks the Serving-GW to create a temporary tunnel between S-eNodeB and T-eNodeB. When the handover procedure will be completed, the tunnel must be eliminated. As a consequence, the Serving-GW confirms the creation of the tunnel, and the S-eNodeB can forward downlink data towards the new base station.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <u>Handover Command</u>: The S1 interface (S1AP protocol) is involved. The MME informs S-eNodeB that the resources for the handover have been prepared at the target side (T-eNodeB). You can find the transparent container, where you can find radio related information through the EPC (Evolved Packet Core). You can find the dedicated resources to the UE in order to carry out the contention-free based random access procedure.\n"
